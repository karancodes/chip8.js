# Chip8.js

Chip8.js aims to bring CHIP8 emulation to the browser and node.js.

A demo of the browser version can be found at: http://reu.github.com/chip8.js

## Tests

There are tests for most of the features implemented (probably the first emulator to have automated tests), they can be run either in node.js or in the browser, by accessing the test/tests.html page (which can be found online at http://reu.github.com/chip8.js/test/tests.html).
