# Chip8.js

Chip8.js aims to bring CHIP8 emulation to the browser and node.js.

A demo of the browser version can be found at: http://reu.github.com/chip8.js

## Current status

At the moment, it can emulate majority of the games. It still glitches in some cases, as pong2 collision detection.

There are tests for most of the features implemented (probably the first emulator to have automated tests), so people can understand better how the emulator works by reading the specs.
